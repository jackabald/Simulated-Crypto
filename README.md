# Simulated Crypto Personal Project
Java program to create local simulated coins, wallets, and markets. Wallets can hold multipe different coins, and the 
market holds multiple wallets and facilitates the transfer of coins between them. I utilize Exception handling, Object
Oriented Programming, and a tester class.
